I am from China and hold a Master’s degree in Neuroscience from the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. I spent five years at the Brain Cognition and Brain Disease Institute (BCBDI), Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT), where my research in Feng Wang’s lab focused on cell type-specific neuronal circuits in the superior colliculus that govern visually-evoked innate behaviors. While exploring the neural mechanisms underlying flexible behavior, I recognized the need for precise and efficient methods to quantify behavior, which inspired me to shift my focus toward AI-driven approaches. My current goal is to use machine learning techniques to quantify movement/sub-movement level behaviors and map them to large-scale neuronal activity signals, providing deeper insights into the computational and control mechanisms of neural circuits.

## Research Interest

Animal’s defensive behaviors, including attack, flight and freezing, are crucial for their survival. However, in various environmental contexts, internal state and past suffering, individual animals exhibit remarkably adaptable protective response when encountering unexpected threats. The Superior Colliculus (SC), an evolutionarily conserved nucleus situated in the midbrain, is one of the key brain regions in processing visually threatening information and guiding defensive behaviors. In addition to directly receive the visual information for the retina, SC integrates a broad spectrum of inputs from various brain regions, including the cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, and the midbrain, which likely convey information about non-visual perception, the state-of-mind or recent experiences. These circuit architectures underpin the flexible processing of visual information in the SC and the generation of adaptable behaviors. However, the precise computational mechanisms by which these circuits orchestrate such adaptable responses remain to be fully elucidated. 

During my master's studies and research assistantship, my primary research focused on investigating cell type-specific neuronal circuits in the superior colliculus that govern visually evoked innate behaviors. I am proficient in analyzing animals’ behavior, trying to be using mechine-learning mmethodsto quantify behavior. And as a student in Neuroscience, I am very familiar with the standard procedures of neural circuit investigation, including virus using strategies, stereotaxic viral injection, perfusion fixation, brain sectioning, staining and imaging. I believe I possess the knowledge and skills necessary to conduct relevant experiments

In my doctoral research proposal, I aim to explore how different cell types within SC selectively integrate and disseminate different visual and other information from various brain regions to guide flexible behaviors. To accomplish this, I will meticulously design the behavior assay with my supervisor and apply a range of approaches, including spatial-omics (Mapseq/Barseq), two-photon calcium imaging, functional ultrasound imaging (fUSi), large-scale neural recordings (Neuropixels), viral labeling, and opto/chemogenetics. Our primary focus will be on identifying and characterizing the synergistic activity patterns of different cell populations under different visual stimulus and tasks. These results will enhance our comprehension of the SC computational ability in effectively processing multiple streams of information and switch to appropriate behaviors. Secondly, we are interested in how brain-wide inputs to the superior colliculus modulate the balance of cell-type specific firing. There are two key scientific questions: the first concerns the conditions under which the specific nucleus projecting to the SC becomes activated, likely associated with information conveyed to the SC. The second question second is how individual inputs influence the output of SC and subsequent animal’s behaviors. By addressing these questions, we anticipate gaining a detailed understanding of how the circuits of the superior colliculus dynamically process visual information to trigger various behaviors. Ultimately, this research will establish a framework for predicting how different inputs modulate the processing of visual information and subsequent actions.
