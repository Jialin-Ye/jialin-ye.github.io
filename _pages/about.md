I am from China and hold a Master’s degree in Neuroscience from the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. I spent five years at the Brain Cognition and Brain Disease Institute (BCBDI), Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT), where my research in Feng Wang’s lab focused on cell type-specific neuronal circuits in the superior colliculus that govern visually-evoked innate behaviors. While exploring the neural mechanisms underlying flexible behavior, I recognized the need for precise and efficient methods to quantify behavior, which inspired me to shift my focus toward AI-driven approaches. My current goal is to use machine learning techniques to quantify movement/sub-movement level behaviors and map them to large-scale neuronal activity signals, providing deeper insights into the computational and control mechanisms of neural circuits.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
