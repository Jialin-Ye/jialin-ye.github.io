	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by social and repetitive abnormalities. Although the ASD mouse model with Shank3b mutations is widely used in ASD research, the behavioral phenotype of this model has not been fully elucidated. Here, a 3D-motion capture system and linear discriminant analysis were used to comprehensively record and analyze the behavioral patterns of male and female Shank3b mutant mice. It was found that both sexes replicated the core and accompanied symptoms of ASD, with significant sex differences. Further, Shank3b heterozygous knockout mice exhibited distinct autistic behaviors, that were significantly different from those those observed in the wild type and homozygous knockout groups. Our findings provide evidence for the inclusion of both sexes and experimental approaches to efficiently characterize heterozygous transgenic models, which are more clinically relevant in autistic studies.},

	abstract = {Many brain functions that underlie behavior, cognition, and emotions vary with age, as does susceptibility to neuropsychological disorders. The expression of specific genes that are involved in these functions, such as the genes encoding for oxytocin, its receptors, and apolipoprotein D, varies with age across different brain regions. The cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R) is one of the most widely spread G-protein coupled receptors in the central nervous system and is increasingly recognized for its important contribution to various brain functions. Although changes in CB1R expression with age have been reported in the male mouse brain, they have not been well investigated in the female brain. Here, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization to target CB1R mRNA in the whole brains of female C57BL/6J mice aged 4, 6, 12, 52 (12 months) and 86 weeks (20 months), and quantified CB1R-positive cells in 36 brain regions across the whole brain. The results showed that CB1R-positive cells number changed with age. Specifically, CB1R expression increased with age in some subregions of the cortex, decreased with age in the lateral septal area, and reached its lowest level at 52 weeks in the thalamus, hypothalamus, and hindbrain subregions. Cluster analysis revealed that some brain regions shared similar temporal characteristics in CB1R-positive cell number across the lifespan. Our results provide evidence that investigation of the neural basis of age-related characteristics of female brain functions is not only warranted but required.},
